								<p>Having taken to heart my mother's advice to "do something constructive", Iâ€™ve
									spent my life being a maker of things: creating complex drawings, tailoring, Photoshopping,
									pouring concrete, writing, teaching, painting, baking, or bettering myself in one
									way or another. My intent has always been to leave a situation better (or at
									least more beautiful) than when I found it.</p>

								<p>An Ohioan by birth, and a New Yorker by choice, I discovered Santa Fe
									in 1993 on a landscape painting trip and never left (sometimes there's just no way around a cliche.) The wide open sky of
									New Mexico is an invitation to remake yourself, and I find myself accepting
									that challenge over and over again.<br />
									<br />
									Technology has been a source of creativity for me since 1990, and I embraced it
									completely in 1997 when I began working for the IT Bureau of the New Mexico
									Environment Department - beginning at the nascent Help Desk, moving on to business
									analyst, and ultimately performing IT project management.

								<p>Both the artistic and the technical sides of my creativity have led me to a
									variety of interesting career moves. I am
									a huge fan of digital tools that make visualizing the creative process
									easier and more accessible. Nobody warned me Excel spreadsheets were a gateway drug...</p>
