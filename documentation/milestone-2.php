  	<h2>Introduction:</h2>

  	<p>Below is an outline for the User Experience and Interaction Design for the Laura Orchard Personal Website Project.
	  This project is a professional portfolio website with a focus on web development and software implementation project
	  management. The target audiences include contract employers, corporate employers, and charitable organizations with web development or implementation project
	  management needs. The primary goal of this site is to provide a way for potential clients, hiring managers, and contract
	  employers to see my work and contact me for employment opportunities.
	</p>



	<h2>Personas</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Persona #1: Contract Client</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name: </strong>Julie Criss Gibson, founder of SJConsulting</li>
			<li><strong>Age: </strong>42</li>
			<li><strong>Technology: </strong>SJ Consulting works in a multitude of content management systems, including
				NetCommunity (Pro, Grow and Spark), Sphere/FAF, Luminate/TeamRaiser, Drupal, WordPress, Sitefinity, Ektron,
				and/or custom platforms. SJC has a team of designers, programmers, and consultants with expertise of online
				and offline databases, email marketing, and software platforms to meet the full spectrum of clients' needs.</li>
			<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Dedicated to working for nonprofits with complex needs, Julie is
				also very keen to create a strong female coding team. Her approach with clients always includes a strategic
				view of the clients’ project that extends to training in email marketing as well as online tools that make
				fundraising and event management seamless to the public. Her approach with her coding team includes mentoring
				and guidance in order to allow each member to improve and excel in their area of expertise while maintaining
				a balanced life outside her company.</li>
			<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>The high volume of requests from the nonprofit sector seeking
				professional solutions to complex technology problems means the need for competent programmers is constant.
				Determining the right technology solutions for each client is taking over Julie’s schedule and she needs to
				feel comfortable completely relying on her staff to execute high quality products and take over the group
				training sessions.</li>
			<li><strong>Goals: </strong>Julie is in need of skilled coding talent from across the country with cross-over
				skills in both project management and technical training for hourly or project-based employment.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<strong>Persona #2: Prospective Employer</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name: </strong>Fred Armisted, Chief Strategy Officer, Fusion Labs</li>
			<li><strong>Age: </strong>65</li>
			<li><strong>Technology: </strong>Fusion creates enterprise level scholarship and grants management software for
				universities and nonprofits with sophisticated online interfaces; his company provides technical consulting;
				system management and hosting; proprietary nonprofit software; and advanced technology implementation.</li>
			<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Fusion Labs has been growing steadily for 5 years and is always
				looking for more coding talent and project managers to keep their project pipeline flowing. Understaffed,
				Fusion too often sends staff with the wrong skill set to the clients for training and/or installations, which has made
				the roll-outs less than successful for understaffed clients. The time it takes to get a charitable
				organization up and running has been getting longer as the programming staff has taken on more peripheral tasks.</li>
			<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>The success of Fusion’s products have taken a bite out of their
				chief competitor, Blackbaud, and they need to maintain this edge in order to remain a viable company. With
				more organizations signing on for installations, they are short on programmers with experience in their
				platform. Disorganized and/or poor project implementation has caused grumbling that could
				cost them future business.</li>
			<li><strong>Goals: </strong>To hire 9 senior programmers and engineers and 2 project managers as soon as
				possible, and then determine the junior positions needed to fill in the gaps. The longer-term goal is to
				increase loyalty and retention so the teams will be more cohesive and productive with less distraction and
				more seamless installations.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<strong>Persona #3: Private Client (potential pro-bono project)</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name: </strong>Santa Fe Meditation Circle</li>
			<li><strong>Composition: </strong>an informal group (a circle) with a membership of 50-plus and a 3-person board of
			directors. The circle is comprised of members from a highly respected worldwide organization, but the circle is not
			officially affiliated with parent group for legal and tax reasons. Median age of the members is 60.</li>
			<li><strong>Technology: </strong>No dedicated technology – each year the administrative tasks and related documents are
			passed from one board to next. The membership uses email, mobile phones and desktops, but are generally not tech-savvy.
			Volunteers use their own equipment to manage the website, mailing list and documents.</li>
			<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>With an older membership, the value of technology and development is
			misunderstood and underestimated – both in terms of cost and functionality. They want something that looks like what
			the larger (more affluent) organizations have. Without an understanding of what is involved, they may not want to pay
			full price (or at all) for the design, development and maintenance. For the past 10 years, one member has taken it
			upon himself to donate his time, using a free template-based site builder and hosting agreement, covering the annual
			cost on his own. He is ready to ditch the old site in favor of one that is more up to date and easy to maintain,
			ultimately passing the responsibility back to the circle as an anticipated annual expense for them to include in
			their budget. All expenses for the circle are covered by donations.</li>
			<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Budget – there has never been a line item for technology (only rent and utilities for the dedicated meeting space).</li>
					<li>A <em>demonstration of value</em> will be necessary to prove that a professional website is the right expenditure for this group
					– they will need to see an invoice for the retail price and maintenance agreement.</li>
					<li>The circle needs a site that will emulate the parent organization’s website, providing the circle’s basic protocol,
					schedule, contact information, and e-news sign up form.</li>
					<li>Updates to the content normally occur monthly.</li>
					<li>Currently, the mailing list and monthly newsletters are handled using MailChimp, but the template is a default
					template without any branding.</li>
					<li>Google Calendar is used for volunteer sign up.</li>
					<li>Documents are now electronic, but not stored on a shared site.</li>
					<li>Training is a huge need from year to year as the board rotates off.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Goals:</strong> The circle needs an easy to maintain, low cost, professional-looking solution that will
			incorporate a dynamic monthly calendar, a newsletter sign-up form, a branded newsletter template, easily editable
			content, and a shared document management system. Clarity on what the annual costs and training that are needed to
			maintain the site and the list. They also need a strategy regarding document management for a virtual office.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Use Cases</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>#1 Contract Client:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			In LinkedIn, Julie Criss Gibson is <em>connected</em> to everyone her company has ever worked for. Because she worked with me on a series of Santa Fe Community Foundation projects, she receives a LinkedIn notice in July suggesting she congratulate me on starting my new job as a web developer.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>From her iPhone, Julie posts the congratulations note on my profile, then clicks on the link to my new website from my LinkedIn profile page.</li>
			<li>From my Home page she clicks on the Services page to see what my skills include.</li>
			<li>She then navigates to the Work page to see my samples. After a few minutes of examining the quality of my work, she clicks on the About page and is pleasantly surprised to see I’ve chosen to focus on clientele similar to hers.</li>
			<li>From the Contact Me page, she clicks on my contact information to update her address book automatically.</li>
			<li>She sends an email, rather than using the contact form, saying she’ll be in New Mexico the following month and would like to set up some time to show me some junior-level work she needs done.</li>
			<li>From this point, the interaction is via email.</li>
		</ol>

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>#2 Prospective Employer:</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Fusion Labs has a full-time recruiter scouring the Internet on her desktop for anyone with Blackbaud, Proffer, FinancialEdge,
			Raiser’s Edge, GrantedGe, or NetCommunity experience. My new site just came up in the results for the first
			time, so she includes my URL link in a list of potential candidates to Fred Armisted. He remembers my name from the
			beta site he managed during Fusion’s early years.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Fred clicks on the URL link and lands on the Home page.</li>
			<li> He quickly navigates to the Services page.</li>
			<li>He skims the Services page to see what I’ve done since we last met. Although my experience as a coder is
				thin, my familiarity with the functionality of six key products in his arsenal puts me into the
				<em>project management</em> category for Fusion.</li>
			<li>Fred has his recruiter contact me by phone for an interview.</li>
			<li>All interaction from this point is by phone and email.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<img src="../images/milestone2_flowchart_2.svg" alt="Flowchart for Prospective Employer" />
		</p>


		<p>
			<strong>#3 Private Client:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Santa Fe Meditation Circle board knows me as a fine artist but was told about my new business and have my
			business card. The three board members are looking at my site together on a laptop at a coffee shop where they are having a brief meeting.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Having been given my website URL, they navigate to my site my Home page, where they see clickable options for About, Work, Services, and Contact.</li>
			<li>They are reading each page with care, as they want to get an idea of my skills and pricing.</li>
			<li>On the About page, they discover that each year I accept a certain amount of pro-bono projects that require a fee-based maintenance agreement.</li>
			<li>They click on the Contact page, and rather than call me at that point, they decide fill out the contact form asking me to a meeting with the board.</li>
			<li>At this point it becomes an email conversation.</li>
		</ol>

		</p>

		<h2>Proposed Site Map</h2>
		<p>
			The minimum viable product for my site will consist of 5 top-level pages, with the potential for sub-pages under the
			Work category. Each page is an opportunity to make my values and needs known to the viewer:
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Home</strong>: The home page is mainly visual with a short introduction. It will contain both obvious and subtle links to the
			other 4 pages. This page introduces the template for the whole site.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Work</strong>: A grid of images that will reflect the various portfolio projects I have completed. Clicking on the image will expand it to reveal additional explanatory text (client, role played, technology, partners involved).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>About</strong>: A brief outline of myself and my focus on creating positive change through human-centered and holistic design. This page will include references to my background in fine art.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Services</strong>: A description of the specific services I provide, my skills, and experience with various technology platforms, web development, programming and project management. This section will be edited as my work experience builds. This page will also include a description of my philosophical approach to building long-standing relationships with organizations and people who are creating positive change.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact</strong>: Basic contact information and a contact form.</p>
		<p>
			<img src="../images/milestone2_sitemap.svg" alt="Sitemap for LOrchard.org" />
		</p>

		<h2>Proposed Features and Functionality</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Being a simple site, there will be a top navigation bar on all pages without andy menu dropdowns.</li>
			<li>If it suits the ultimate design, I’ll use Bootstrap glyph icons from the bootstrap components.</li>
			<li>There will be navigation links on all imagery.</li>
			<li>A footer bar will be included on all pages. It will indicate professional affiliations, social media icons, contact information, and a "Partners and Collaborators" section.</li>
			<li>The Home page will include an animated feature that has yet to be designed (or found in a CSS library).</li>
			<li>The Work page will display my portfolio of projects by using a Bootstrap <em>thumbnail component with custom content</em> to describe each project, including my partners and collaborators.</li>
			<li>The use of a custom background, type-face, font colors, animation, and layout will be designed with front-end clients in mind.</li>
			<li>The contact form will be included as required, but this will be removed later.</li>
			<li>The content of each page will provide an opportunity to clarify my values and expectations for myself, my collaborators, and my clients.</li>
		</ul>
